  <i>
    A focused repository for practicing MySQL fundamentals, relational database concepts,
    and real-world SQL querying techniques.
  </i>
</p>

<hr/>


<h2 align="center">🎯 Purpose of This Repository</h2>

<p align="center">
  This repository is designed to build a <b>strong, practical foundation in MySQL
  and relational database querying</b>, focusing on how data is structured,
  stored, and retrieved in real-world systems.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Databases are a critical component of almost every modern application.
  This project emphasizes understanding <b>how SQL queries interact with
  relational data</b> rather than treating databases as black boxes.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The primary goals of this repository are to:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Develop clarity in <b>relational database concepts</b><br/>
  ✔ Practice writing <b>clean, readable, and efficient SQL queries</b><br/>
  ✔ Understand how real datasets are queried and shaped for applications<br/>
  ✔ Build confidence in using MySQL as a backend data store<br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Instead of focusing on isolated commands, the scripts in this repository
  are structured to reflect <b>industry-style SQL usage</b>, where queries
  are written with intent, correctness, and readability in mind.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This repository serves as a <b>learning portfolio</b> that demonstrates
  foundational database skills required for software engineering,
  backend development, and data-driven applications.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">📂 Repository Structure & Script Overview</h2>

<p align="center">
  This repository is intentionally kept <b>clean and focused</b>,
  with each SQL file targeting a specific learning objective
  within MySQL and relational database querying.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Instead of combining multiple concepts into a single script,
  each file is designed to <b>isolate and reinforce</b>
  an important SQL concept commonly used in industry.
</p>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">🗂️ SQL Files Included</h3>

<p align="center">
  The repository currently contains the following SQL scripts:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • <b>Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.sql</b><br/>
  • <b>Select Statement.sql</b><br/>
  • <b>Limit and Aliasing.sql</b>
</p>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">📌 Role of Each Script</h3>

<p align="center">
  <b>Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.sql</b> focuses on
  <b>database and table creation</b>. It introduces schema design,
  column definitions, and the foundational structure required
  before any querying can occur.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Select Statement.sql</b> demonstrates how to
  <b>retrieve data from relational tables</b> using SELECT queries.
  It emphasizes filtering, sorting, and reading structured data
  in a meaningful way.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Limit and Aliasing.sql</b> builds on basic querying by showing
  how to <b>control result size</b> and <b>improve query readability</b>
  using LIMIT clauses and column aliases.
</p>

<br/>

<p align="center">
  This modular structure reflects <b>industry best practices</b>,
  where database scripts are written with a clear purpose,
  proper naming, and logical separation.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🧱 Database Schema & Data Modeling</h2>

<p align="center">
  A well-designed database schema is the foundation of any reliable
  data-driven system. This repository emphasizes understanding
  <b>how data is structured before it is queried</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Rather than treating tables as simple containers,
  the schema in this repository reflects
  <b>relational database modeling principles</b>
  commonly used in industry.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">📐 Schema Design Philosophy</h3>

<p align="center">
  The database schema is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind,
  ensuring that each table has a clear responsibility and purpose.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Key design considerations include:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Meaningful table and column naming<br/>
  ✔ Appropriate data types for each column<br/>
  ✔ Logical grouping of related data<br/>
  ✔ Readable and maintainable structure<br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  This approach mirrors real-world practices where schema readability
  directly impacts query accuracy and long-term maintainability.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">🗃️ Table Creation & Structure</h3>

<p align="center">
  The <b>Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.sql</b> script focuses on
  creating the database and defining tables with clear intent.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Column definitions are chosen to represent real entities
  and attributes, allowing queries to operate on
  <b>meaningful and realistic datasets</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Even at a learning level, attention is given to how tables
  might scale as data grows, reinforcing the importance of
  good design from the beginning.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">🔗 Relational Thinking</h3>

<p align="center">
  While this repository focuses on foundational SQL,
  it encourages <b>relational thinking</b> rather than flat data storage.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Understanding how tables relate conceptually prepares learners
  for more advanced topics such as joins, constraints,
  and normalized database design.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This mindset is essential in industry environments,
  where databases often serve as the backbone
  for multiple applications and services.
</p>

<hr/>

<p align="center">
  By focusing on schema design alongside querying,
  this repository builds a strong foundation
  for backend development and data-centric systems.
</p>

<hr/>


<h2 align="center">📊 SQL Querying & Data Retrieval</h2>

<p align="center">
  Data querying is where a database delivers real value.
  This repository focuses on writing <b>clear, intentional, and readable SQL queries</b>
  that reflect how data is retrieved in industry environments.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Rather than complex one-liners, queries are structured to be
  <b>easy to understand, debug, and extend</b>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">🔍 SELECT Statements</h3>

<p align="center">
  The <b>Select Statement.sql</b> script demonstrates the core
  <b>SELECT</b> operation, which is the most frequently used
  command in relational databases.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The script focuses on:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Retrieving specific columns instead of using SELECT *<br/>
  ✔ Reading query output as structured datasets<br/>
  ✔ Understanding how row-based results are returned<br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  This approach encourages disciplined querying, which is
  critical when working with large or production datasets.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">🧮 Filtering with WHERE</h3>

<p align="center">
  Filtering data is essential to extract only relevant information.
  The queries demonstrate how <b>WHERE clauses</b> are used to
  apply conditions on rows.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Common filtering patterns include:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Equality and comparison operators<br/>
  ✔ Logical conditions (AND / OR)<br/>
  ✔ Meaningful filtering for business-style queries<br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  This mirrors real-world usage where queries must return
  precise and context-specific results.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">📐 Sorting with ORDER BY</h3>

<p align="center">
  Query results are often required in a specific order.
  The repository demonstrates the use of <b>ORDER BY</b>
  to control result sequencing.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Sorting is applied to:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Improve result readability<br/>
  ✔ Prepare datasets for reporting or UI display<br/>
  ✔ Ensure consistent output ordering<br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Understanding ordering is important in applications
  where data presentation matters.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3 align="center">📉 Result Limiting & Aliasing</h3>

<p align="center">
  The <b>Limit and Aliasing.sql</b> script focuses on
  shaping query output for practical use.
</p>

<p align="center">
  It demonstrates:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Using <b>LIMIT</b> to restrict result size<br/>
  ✔ Applying <b>aliases</b> to improve column readability<br/>
  ✔ Making query results suitable for downstream consumption<br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  These techniques are commonly used in dashboards,
  APIs, and reporting layers.
</p>

<hr/>

<p align="center">
  Together, these querying patterns form the foundation
  of professional SQL usage, ensuring data is retrieved
  efficiently, clearly, and with purpose.
</p>
